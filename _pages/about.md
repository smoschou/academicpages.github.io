About me
======
I am a plasma astrophysics expert and my speciality in the last few years has been the study of the solarstellar
relation regarding activity events and the effects of activity on (exo)planetary magnetospheres and
habitability. More specifically, my work is focused on phenomena associated with magnetic reconnection,
such as shocks, particle acceleration and multi-wavelength emission and their energy partition in different
regimes.
