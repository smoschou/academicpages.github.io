### PhD in Computational Plasma Astrophysics

I am a Postodoctal Research Fellow at the High Energy Astrophysics Division of the Center for Astrophysics \| Harvard & Smithsonian. I am a plasma astrophysics expert and my speciality in the last few years has been the study of the solarstellar relation regarding activity events and the effects of activity on (exo)planetary magnetospheres and habitability. More specifically, my work is focused on phenomena associated with magnetic reconnection, such as shocks, particle acceleration and multi-wavelength emission and their energy partition in different regimes.
